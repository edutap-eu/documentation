# Architecture of the eduTAP Core

The eduTAP Core is a collection of components to create, issue, and manage passes.

It provides generic components to be used and installed at the {term}`HEIs<HEI>`, but does not contain parts specific to the software and databases used at the institutions. Latter are part of the eduTAP {term}`MaSAs<MaSA>`.

It contains the following main components:

- Libraries to communicate with the vendor-specific wallet APIs, like with Google, Apple, or {term}`HCE` systems like NXP, Legic and HID. In the future, other wallet providers are planned to be supported.
- An abstract vendor-neutral library to support all libraries above on a simplified level by providing a unified API.
- A scalable event-based system to distribute data emitted by wallet actions.
- a callback handler to proxy events emitted by the wallet provider to the eduTAP system.
  The events are emitted if a pass is saved or deleted in the holder's {term}`wallet`.
- Front ends to manage and issue passes:
  - A "Pass Management Portal" to create/ update pass classes (including a generic "Pass Designer") and manage the lifecycle of pass objects,
  - A white label "Pass User Portal" (web and kiosk modes) to apply for passes and manage their passes.
    It can be configured to define which {term}`pass classes <pass class>` are to be managed.

## Wallet specific API Libraries

A set of libraries to be used by developers writing management software for passes to interact with the specific vendor REST APIs.

In eduTAP the APIs are meant to be used by the Pass Management Portal and the Pass User Portal.

It is planned to support the following vendors

- Apple
- Google
- HCE vendors (NXP, Legic, HID)
- EUDI Wallet
- Open Wallet Foundation

```{todo}
Add Links to the vendors wallet pages
```
```{todo}
Link the concepts.
```

At first, we will implement APIs for Google and Apple. The next part focuses on this.

For both, pass objects and pass classes the API provides the following functionality:
- create,
- read,
- update,
- notify (messaging)
- manage the state (lifecycle),
- list (with basic filters).

There are predefined, vendor-specific {term}`stereotypes <stereotype>` and specific types of pass classes.
The library defines models for all of these.
The models can be referenced by name on the above operations using a registry.

First, the libraries will be implemented using Python.
There will be a Python package for each vendor, at first:

- `edutap.wallet_google`
- `edutap.wallet_apple`

Both libraries follow the same structure and public API, as well as upcoming APIs.
In the future, there might be also a JAVA-based (other languages welcome) implementation of those libraries.

To communicate updates of passes to Apple devices we need to implement a web service to be contacted by the Apple wallet as a client.
This is a special case and we will provide a FastAPI application with the library.

# Vendor-neutral Wallet Library

The library depends on all vendor-specific libraries and provides a vendor-neutral facade to the most common functionality.

```{todo}
The details and architecture needs to be refined if the vendor-specific implemenations are mostly done.
```

## Event system

The event system handles data generated by the creation and usage of passes.
It works asynchronously by producing the data as an event and providing it in a message queue.
It then can be read by one or more consumers to be further processed, like being stored in a third-party system.

```{todo}
add a mermaid diagram to illustrate the flow
```

The event system in its core

1. takes information from callback services or other producers,
1. stores the information temporarily in a message queue
1. information gets consumed and is further processed

Examples of types of information handled:
- applications for passes and updates to those applications (common identity pass/ service pass)
- pass creation/ update from vendors via callbacks
- handle data generated by MaSA, like a check-in to an event.
